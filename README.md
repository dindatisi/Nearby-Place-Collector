# Nearby-Place-Collector

## Overview
This app will collect list of nearby places along a short journey. It takes the middle point in the route and then search for place of interest. The list are gathered from google maps &amp; instagram API. After getting the lists, the app will save them in two separate file, one for google maps, and one for instagram place list.

## Dependency
- pandas
- google maps https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python
(I will remove the google maps python module and use only the API. Hopefully soon.)
